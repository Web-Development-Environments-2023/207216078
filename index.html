<h2>Q&A</h2>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Question 1 - Three differences between web1, web2, web3</h3>
As we saw in class, each one of web1, web2, web3 are different generations of the world wide web, each one have name that summarized their goal: <br/>
web1 "The read-only web",<br/>
web2 "The participative social web", <br/>
web3 "The read, write, execute web"<br/>
<br/>
The first difference between the three is the <b>user participations</b>. <br/>
when in web1 he can read, <br/>
in web2 he can read and write - information is exchanged among users on social media platforms,<br/>
and in web3 the use of the user in the web is more portable and personal - adapted to the individual needs. <br/>
<br/>
The second difference is the <b>focus of each web</b>. <br/>
In web1 the focus is on the company publishes the information, <br/>
in web2 the focus is on the community, thanks to the to user's ability to exchange content, <br/>
in web3 the focus in on the individual since the use of the user in the web is more portable and personal - adapted to the individual needs. <br/>
<br/>
The third difference is the <b>goal of the web</b>. <br/>
In web1 information sharing is the main goal, therefore the inforamtion is mostly static. <br/>
In web2 interaction is the main goal, it aims to connect people and introduction of web applications. <br/>
In web3 the goal is to create "smart web" based of the needs of the individual, where the same web/data can be shown differently to different users. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>Question 2 - use case example to demonstrate the differences mentioned above </h3>
for the query - "Hotels in Amsterdam" <br/>
We expect that in all networks the result will be a list of hotels in Amsterdam, but the content itself will be completely different. <br/>
In web1, the outcome will be static list of hotels in Amsterdam, when the list will be built mainly based on publications of the hotels themselves. <br/>
In web2, the list will be built mainly based on different users of the web, thing that allow users to share experiences and reviews about hotels. <br/>
For example, we can see rates of hotels, photos, expereiences of other users, hence we get more reliable information about hotels in Amsterdam. <br/>
In web3, the list will be mainly adapted to the user who performed the search.
For example it could be ranked by users reviews, adapted to hotels I visited in and enjoyed the stay or hotels I recently viewd and show interest,<br/>
Intrest can be evident in several aspects based on different algorithms, such as time I spent in the web page,<br/>
"LIKE" buttons I clicked, pages I returned to several times and more.<br/>
In conclusion, In web1 the result will be static and factual information, <br/>
in web2 the information will be based in sharing informations between different users,<br/>
and in web 3 we will recieve results that are adapted to the need and nature of the searcher's search.<br/>
